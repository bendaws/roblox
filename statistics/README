Stats module
(Last updated: August 27, 2020)
=======================
This is really a server statistics tracker. For a server's lifespan, it will track and keep up with any values you want and store them for servers and clients to use.

It is used in Crossroads to provide the server statistics panel and was originally designed for that.
Here is it's use cases:

- Players, to track a number of kills across the whole server
- Admins, to track the amount of reports of a specific player in the server
- Developers, to count runtime errors that are understandable

It is essentially variables++.

Functions
===============================
statistics.set(stat_name: string, value: any) -- Sets the given statistic. Returns true or false based on if it was successful.

statistics.get(stat_name: string) -- Gets the value of a statistic. Return the value, or "nil" if not found.

statistics.list() -- Returns the whole statistics list

Usage
===============================
When requiring the module, it will return the module itself as well as a unique version identifier.
It will look like this:

"binx-statistics-iden-X.X.X"

It is useful to make sure that you are using the expected version. You can ignore it completely as well.

Example
===============================
local stats_module = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.statistics)

function kill_happened()
    stats_module.set("kills", stats_module.get("kills") + 1)
end

function bullet_happened()
    stats_module.set("bullets fired", stats_module.get("bullets fired") + 1)
end
