# SirKingBinx's Roblox Code
This is a lot of code that I felt would be useful for other developers and noobies learning how to code for the first time. I have been a solo developer for almost 6 years
and have learned the entire Luau language from scratch.

For new Roblox developers looking for information and history on Roblox's coding, the [Luau repository](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau) may help you.
